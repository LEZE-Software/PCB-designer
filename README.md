# Free PCB designer
 
 Hello and welcome in the repo for my free circuit board designer!

In my freetime I'm working with circuit boards and arduino boards. I planned the circuits with pen and paper, so I coded a simple tool to plan the boards on the computer. 

It is possible to plan a board and to export it via screenshot.

The version 1.0 is not the final version.
If you are interested take a look in the issues. I've planned some features for future releases.
There is also a function planned to switch the language between english and german.
